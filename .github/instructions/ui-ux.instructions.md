- Limit color palette to 2-3 primary colors plus accents.
- Apply modern typography with clear hierarchy (headings, subheadings, body)

## Layout & Structure

- Build intuitive, user-friendly navigation
- Ensure responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Use grid-based layouts for consistent alignment and spacing

## UI Elements

- Design custom icons that match the visual style

- Add subtle animations and transitions for polish
- Include shadcn ui components where appropriate
- Use lucide icons for consistency and simplicity

## UX Best Practices

- Provide clear visual feedback for user actions

## Implementation Notes
